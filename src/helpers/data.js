      "At present people from a BAME background remain under-represented in applications and appointments to become independent prison monitors in Scotland. The Scottish Prison Service and the Scottish Prison Monitoring System are therefore missing a potential pool of talent and experience from the BAME community because of this under-representation. Representatives from HMIPS highlighted the importance of having representations from various ethnic backgrounds as Prison monitors to ensure fair justices as is the very aim of the FJSS Group.",
